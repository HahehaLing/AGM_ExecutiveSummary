## Executive Summary
### todo: grab the figures and insert in this readme too 
From the notebooks' figures, we know that the customers like Pistachio Salmons the most. This is true for all different spending group as shown in the Pistachio Salmon sales, which consists of on average about 20% of all meals sold.

The following are my main 2 recommendations:
  1) AGM can do a rewards / rebate program. For example, for every 10 meals bought, the customers can earn some rewards point and exchange for some free Pistachio Salmon meals. This rewards system would favour the ones that purhcase more and in turn generate more interests and sales. The reasoning behind this is to make the customers "yearn" to get to the top and collect more points / stickers / stamp on their rewards card - as if they were playing a game. Furthermore, customers may also round up their quantity of purchases to make the 10 meals minimum. For example, if they intended to buy 8 meals, but see the reward system minimum of 10 meals purchase, these customers may add 2 more meals to their purchase.

  - Have a expiry date on the rewards point. To further drive the "gaming" mentality, AGM could implement an expiry on the rewards point to further incentivize individuals to meet the threshold purchase amount in a timely manner. This helps ensure recency, frequency and monetary value of the customer by bringing in customers in a consistent stream in the near future.

  - AGM should also consider sending clients updates about new promotions and about the upcoming expiry of their meal purchases. These reminders may bring in recurring and higher frequency travels in the stores and generate more sales. Once the customers come into the store, the smell and sight of food, suck-cost fallacy, rewards point system, and the fast depleting energy from doing the strenuous exercise of shopping all calls for more purchases!

  2) Sell similar type of food items to Pistachio Salmon. AGM can consider carrying more seafood item (e.g. sushi, tuna bowls...etc.) and/ or similarly flavoured cusine. This way the food selection will more align with the taste of the customers. However, such move should be implemented with some other surveys and market analysis on the newly introduced product.

  - To extend on (2), it would be wise to change up the menu items (maybe replace the less popular food item like Chicken salad) and keep the customers surprised with the changing menu. This would help ensure high sales of the carried food items and replace the less popular items.
